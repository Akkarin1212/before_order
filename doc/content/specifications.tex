\section{Specifications}
\subsection{Facebook Chatbot}
The service will be provided to the user by utilizing the Facebook chatbot. The following figure Fig. \ref{fig:facebook_overview} further details the general design of the system. Requests from the user will be processed by the bot using a text recognition software and our own database with information about various dishes.

Using the Facebook Messenger as interface for our service, the user doesn't have to download a separate application and is already accustomed to navigate within the application and its usage. In order to use the service the user has to search for the \emph{Before Order} page on Facebook and send the profile a message by clicking the \emph{Send Message} button.

\subsubsection{Facebook messenger}

Given that the user has sent a message to the \emph{Before Order} service, the chat will be easily accessible from then on in the chatroom section of the Facebook Messenger application.

By selecting \emph{Before Order} from the list, the user is now able to provide a picture or dish names in the Korean alphabet to the chatbot by sending an image or a text message as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:facebook_message}

\subsubsection{Chatbot input}

If the user sends the menu in form of a picture, the dish names have to be spelled out and need to be visible. The user can either send a picture that he took in the past or use the camera function in the Facebook Messenger to capture a picture and directly send it to the chatbot.

Using a text recognition API and analyzing the image we are able to provide a list with all the found and supported dish names. The user is now able to select a dish that he wants more detailed information about as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:facebook_response}.
